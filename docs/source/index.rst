FluxSim Documentation
======================

FluxSim packages a full DNS fast-flux laboratory into a Docker stack—complete with proxy agents,
load balancers, CDN-style edges, observability, and a rich command-line interface. This manual
guides you through installation, CLI fundamentals, topology orchestration, and embedding FluxSim in
teaching or research pipelines.

.. note::

   FluxSim is under active development. Expect rapid iteration while the project stabilises for
   broader open-source collaboration.
